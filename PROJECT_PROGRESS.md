## 🎯 **CURRENT STATUS: FULLY FUNCTIONAL**

The Station Assignment Scheduler application is now **completely functional** and meets all requirements specified in the SRS. The application successfully:

1. **Imports personnel data** with German CSV support and manual entry
2. **Manages station configuration** with default stations and full CRUD operations
3. **Generates fair schedules** using constraint-based algorithms across 11 time slots
4. **Displays schedules** in multiple views (calendar, person, station)
5. **Exports to CSV** with automatic data cleanup for privacy compliance
6. **Maintains GDPR compliance** with session-only storage and explicit consent

### Core Algorithm Performance
- ✅ Fair distribution (±1 assignment per person)
- ✅ Respects morning/evening shift exclusions
- ✅ Covers Monday evening through Saturday evening (11 slots)
- ✅ Distributes across all active stations
- ✅ Provides fairness metrics and validation

### User Experience Features
- ✅ Intuitive linear workflow
- ✅ Responsive design for desktop and mobile
- ✅ German language interface
- ✅ Real-time validation and error handling
- ✅ Privacy notices and GDPR compliance
- ✅ Quick navigation between all workflow steps
