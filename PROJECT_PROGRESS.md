# Station Assignment Scheduler - Development Progress

## Project Overview
Building a Next.js web application for fair distribution of personnel across multiple station locations throughout a weekly schedule.

## 🚀 **CRITICAL BUG FIX (2025-01-28)**

### **Date Generation Bug Fixed**
- **Problem**: The for loop in `generateTimeSlots()` was modifying the same Date object reference in each iteration
- **Impact**: All assignments had the same date, causing CSV export to show "01.01.2025" for all entries
- **Solution**: Fixed with proper while loop creating new Date objects for each iteration
- **Files**: `lib/scheduling/engine.ts` - `generateTimeSlots()` method
- **Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED** - Date generation now produces correct individual dates for each time slot
